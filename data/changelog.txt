### v1 -> v2
meteo_daily_*.csv - previous version contained wrong daily mean, min and max values since 1966. In fact they were the hourly ones. Fixed.
SNOW_THICKNESS erroneously contained zero values for the non-observed time spans. Removed.
meteo_hourly_*.csv - fixed a bug with a missing minus sign in the air temperature of some winter months.

peat-temp_*.csv - added QC parameter (zero value indicates doubtful value)
Observations before 1960, measured with other equipment, are now in a separate file
