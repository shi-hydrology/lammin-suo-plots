## Правила журнала ESSD про оформление рисунков ([первоисточник](https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/submission.html#figurestables)):
**Colour schemes:** it is important that the colour schemes used in your maps and charts allow readers with colour vision deficiencies to correctly interpret your findings. Please check your figures using the Coblis – Color Blindness Simulator and revise the colour schemes accordingly.
**Figure composition**: it is important for the production process that separate figures are submitted. Composite figures containing multiple panels should be collected into one file before submission. The figures should be labelled correctly with Arabic numerals (e.g. fig01, fig02). They can be submitted in *.pdf, *.ps, *.eps, *.jpg, *.png, or *.tif format and should have a resolution of 300 dpi. The width should not be less than 8 cm. A legend should clarify all symbols used and should appear in the figure itself, rather than verbal explanations in the captions (e.g. "dashed line" or "open green circles"). The produced paper file will contain all figures in *.jpg or *.png format. However, if authors use vector graphics, readers can download such files labelled "high-resolution" from the full-text HTML version online. Tips for producing high-quality line graphics:
1. The first choice should be vector graphics in *.eps or *.pdf format. Fonts must be embedded. Please make sure that the *.pdf files do not contain hidden objects. If you want to adjust fonts in your original figure file before converting into *.pdf, please make sure that you change the actual font of the original figure rather than adding text boxes or other additional layers.
2. Please use only one font family in your figures (e.g. Arial or Helvetica) and consider using sans-serif fonts. Keep in mind that the usage of regular, italic, bold, and bold-italic of one font family already leads to four different fonts that must be embedded or adjusted by our image processors in case of text corrections within figures.
3. If the processing of your vector figures requires an exceptional amount of time due to multiple fonts or hidden objects, we reserve the right to convert your *.eps or *.pdf figures into *.png files for the further production process.
4. If the usage of vector graphics is not possible, a bitmap image should be saved in a "non-lossy" format (e.g. *.png). A high quality is recommended. It is always possible to reduce the size of the figure later.
5. The *.jpg format should only be used for photos. It is not suitable for sharp edges. Note that it is not advisable to convert a *.jpg file back to *.png. If *.jpg files must be used please save them with high quality.
6. If you are not able to fulfil the above-mentioned criteria, it is also possible to submit figures produced with Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign in the original file format. Our image processors will then produce the figures from these source files.
The abbreviation "Fig." should be used when it appears in running text and should be followed by a number unless it comes at the beginning of a sentence, e.g.: "The results are depicted in Fig. 5. Figure 9 reveals that...".


**Figure content guidelines:** in order to facilitate consistency with our language and typesetting guidelines applied to the text of the manuscript, please keep the following in mind when producing your figures:
Labels of panels must be included with brackets around letters being lower case (e.g. (a), (b), etc.).
Ranges need an en dash and no spaces between start and end (e.g. 1–10, Jan–Feb).
Coordinates need a degree sign and a space when naming the direction (e.g. 30° N, 25° E).
Spaces must be included between number and unit (e.g. 1 %, 1 m).
Units must be written exponentially (e.g. W m–2).
Common abbreviations to be applied: hour as h (not hr), kilometre as km, metre as m.
Capitalization: only the first word is capitalized in headers (in addition to proper nouns). More guidelines are provided in section English guidelines and house standards.


**Figure captions:** each illustration should have a concise but descriptive caption. The abbreviations used in the figure must be defined, unless they are common abbreviations or have already been defined in the text. Figure captions should be included in the text file and not in the figure files.


**File size:** authors are kindly asked to find the best balance between the quality of figures and submitted material on the one hand, and a manageable file size on the other hand. Individual figures in the *.pdf format should not exceed 2 MB, file types other than *.pdf should not exceed 5 MB per figure, and the overall size of all submitted files, excluding supplements, should not exceed 30 MB.


**Plot data:** authors are encouraged to publicize the data needed to create the plots, which are included in the manuscript, in order to enable reviewers and readers to reproduce the plots. Ideally, such plot data is treated like any other research data and should be deposited in FAIR-aligned data repositories that assign persistent identifiers (see section data sets).


**Tables:** they should be numbered sequentially with Arabic numerals. For the production of the accepted manuscript, they should be submitted as MS WORD or included in the LaTeX file. Tables submitted as a PDF or an image file cannot be processed. Tables should be self-explanatory and include a concise, yet sufficiently descriptive caption. Coloured table cells should be avoided. Horizontal lines should normally only appear above and below the table, and as a separator between the head and the main body of the table. Please note that the word "Table" is never abbreviated and should be capitalized when followed by a number (e.g. Table 4).


**Reproduction and reuse of figures and tables:** authors must secure the right to reproduce any material that has already been published or copyrighted elsewhere, and corresponding citations must be included in the text as well as in the captions. If distribution licences other than CC BY are applied, corresponding statements must be included in the captions. If authors adapt figures from other authors they must still cite the original authors and indicate that the figure was adapted. There are three cases:
Figures entirely compiled by the manuscript authors: since such figures are part of the manuscript they will receive the same distribution licence as the entire manuscript, namely a CC BY License. No citation is needed and no reproduction rights must be obtained.
Figures entirely taken from another author: such figures do not follow the distribution licence of the manuscript. A citation must properly indicate the original source and reproduction rights must be granted before submitting your manuscript.
Figures adapted from another author: although you adapted such a figure and included your own intellectual work, the underlying figure is still taken from another source. The citation in the figure caption must indicate the adaptation (e.g. "(adapted from Smith et al., 2014)") and the reproduction rights must be granted before submission.
